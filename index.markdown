Hi, I'm Ben Perlmutter, a software developer currently studying to get a whole lot better in the [App Academy](https://appacademy.io/) online bootcamp.

I have experience with Javascript, mainly on the front-end, but also a lil bit of node for running JS locally and creating servers. Gracias a App Academy, the scope of stuff that I can do is expanding every single day.

I'm trying to keep a blog here to document all the stuff I'm learning and how I feel as I progress. They also say that keeping a blog is one of the best things you can do to help with the job search. So hey, let's give it a try! 

If you want to read some more about me, check out the [about page](/_site/about/index.html). You can also give me a follow on my socio-professional media: [Github](https://github.com/bpmutter) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-perlmutter-a410228a/) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bpmutter).

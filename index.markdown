Hi, I'm Ben Perlmutter, a full-stack software developer.

Welcome to my website. Here you can find my [blog](/blog.html), [my portfolio](https://github.com/bpmutter/), and some more information [about me](/about.html). You may also notice lots of Bitmojis that do silly things. Click around and try to find all the effects (or just [look at the codebase](https://github.com/bpmutter/ben.perlmutter.io)). 

I also love to write and try to have an entrepreneurial attitude toward life. I previously founded PerlWrite, a content creation business and have managed to hack my way to living in 3 countries in the past 4 years, in addition to traveling to quite a few others. To learn more, check out the [about page](/about.html).

You can also give me a follow on my socio-professional media: 
<br> [Github](https://github.com/bpmutter) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-perlmutter-a410228a/) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bpmutter).

                        <p>I feel like Javascript is the English of the web development world. Despite all of its weirdness, it's everywhere. Regardless if you like it, you  definitely learn it. </p>
                        <p>And like English, Javascript is my 'first language' of programming. It was the first language that I achieved real proficiency in, and I am better able to translate my ideas from logical abstraction to working code in Javascript than any other language.</p>
                        <p>While I ‚ô•Ô∏è React dearly, I also feel quite comfortable with Vanilla JS, and using it to create interfaces.</p>

                    <div class="technologies__description-content">
                        <p>How do I put this...before learning React, I didn't know I could have this strong an emotional connection to a technology. I LOVE React. It is elegant (certain prop threading situations aside). And more importantly, you can make some seriously cool stuff with it with minimal headache thanks to its amazing ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>I have experience with React, Redux, Material UI, the Google Maps API, and more. I looks forward to learning new technologies within the React ecosystem and growing as a React developer.</p>

                    <h4 class="technologies__header">CSS</h4>
                    <div class="technologies__description-content">
                        <p>Having a nice looking and engaging project is obviously important. No matter how beautifully written your  Javascript is, no one will want to use your project unless it looks nice. CSS makes that possible.</p>
                        <p>For that, I am appreciative of CSS and acknowledge its importance. However, CSS is not my favorite part of software development‚Äîit can be tedious and challenging to debug.</p> 
                        <p>With all that being said, I consider myself pretty decent at creating nice looking styles in CSS. (The styling on this site was made all with plain ol' CSS and a bit of SASS.) I also highly value the awesome CSS and UI frameworks like Material, Bootstrap and more.</p>

                        <p>You're currently looking at Jekyll site! I really like Jekyll because it lets you rapidly spin up a presentable site, and easily deploy via Github pages. Jekyll sites are also highly customizable with a bit of time, effort and persistance. </p>
                        <p>This site, for instance, is actually my heavily hacked version of the base Jekyll theme minima. I just threw a whole bunch of CSS, JS, and Bitmoji on top of the theme to make the site you're looking at. If you'd like to learn more about the site you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/bpmutter/ben.perlmutter.io" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.</p>

                    <div class="technologies__description-content">
                        <p>Before I learned React, I got pretty proficient with the Pug templating engine. More than anything else, my experience with Pug makes me appreciate React more. However, with that being said, I value Pug for its ability to render dynamic content from the server with minimal client-side Javascript.</p>

                    <p>I'm a big fan of Javascript, and that extends to the server side. I have built multiple projects with Express, both large and small. What I really appreciate about Express is how well it lends itself to large projects, small ones, and everything in between.</p>

                    <p>In the not too distant future, I would also like to learn web scraping in Python and how to perform data analytics with the language. My academic background is actually in math and statistical political science, so I would like to combine this knowledge with my newer coding ability.</p>

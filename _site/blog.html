        <p>My single favorite thing about software development is the constant learning. And unlike many domains, most all of that learning is applied. (something I talk more about <a href="/blog/personal/2020/04/25/Why-I'm-Becoming-a-Developer.html#infinite-learning-opportunity">here</a>)</p>

<p>For instance, if I read some book about the evolution of the American political economy, I can sound nice at a cocktail party, which is cool, I guess. (Though I don’t know if I’ve actually ever been to a cocktail party…) But the utility of that knowledge basically stops there. Now that’s not me knocking learning for the sake of learning, and I will read that book about the American political economy.</p>

<p>But what makes software development such a rewarding <em>vocation</em> for me is that this is rarely the case. When you learn a new skill, you can put it to use. And, not only that, someone might pay you a bunch of money to put it to use!</p>

<p>So, without further ado or rambling preamble, here are a couple of the top technologies I want to learn and why I’d like to learn them. I’ll try to update the list periodically reflecting new stuff I want to learn, and removing stuff that I have in fact learned.</p>

        <p>RappaMappa is a fullstack <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/">MERN</a> app that lets the user explore where rappers have come from and access information about the artist.</p>

<p>Users can visually explore the map, which features 581 artists, and search for artists with the integrated search box.</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The following document is an adapted from the project’s Github README. The project was made in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/JBui923">Johnny Bui</a> (front-end lead) and <a href="https://github.com/giancarlo-sanchez">Giancarlo Sanchez</a> (backend lead), and myself (project manager). The code for the project represents a collaborative effort of us three.</p>

<!-- One of my responsibilities was creating the README file for the project, and my first foray into writing about my code for a public. It was more fun and less painful than I though it'd be.  -->

<!-- Below is an overview of the project, lightly adapted from the Github project README.  -->

<h2 id="tappdin-at-a-glance">Tappdin At a Glance</h2>
<p>Tappdin is a beer tracking app modeled on <a href="https://untappd.com/">Untappd</a>. It allows users to create accounts, post and delete checkins of beers, view the checkins of other users, and discover new beers.</p>

<p>Tappdin currently possesses a database of 500 beers from almost 20 breweries that users can explore and review, which we call <strong>checkins</strong> to maintain consistency with the original Untappd app.</p>

        <p>I am now about 8 months into learning software development, and it’s been 4 months since I started studying full time, and 2 months since I started the App Academy online bootcamp.</p>

<p>The other day, I was thinking upon my journey so far, what I’ve done right, and what I’d do differently.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the choices I’ve made and the direction I’ve gone, but there is always room for improvement. In another article some time soon, I’d like to discuss what those steps have been.</p>

<p>In this post, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what, if I were to start from zero, I would do. I hope that this article can serve as guidance to anyone looking to get into the software development field. It can be daunting to start learning programming on your own. What language to start? What courses and resources to use? How much to practice?</p>

        <p>I can put an exact date on when I decided I wanted to become a software developer. It was the night before my 25th birthday, November 1, 2019.</p>

<p>I was in Mexico City on vacation. I’d decided to go to CDMX for my birthday because my birthday, November 2, is also the Day of the Dead and that’s always something I’ve wanted to experience. And probably more importantly, I have a deep aversion to all the attention you get on your birthday. I wanted to not just escape that in a foreign country, but have it be overwhelmed by the attention granted to another holiday.</p>

<p>Plus, tacos al pastor, tequila, mesoamerican pyramids, mole, and more tacos al pastor. (Side note: I gained at least 5 pounds during my 2 weeks in Mexico.)</p>

        <p>I am now about 8 months into learning software development, and it’s been 4 months since I started studying full time, and 2 months since I started the App Academy online bootcamp.</p>

<p>The other day, I was thinking upon my journey so far, what I’ve done right, and what I’d do differently.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the choices I’ve made and the direction I’ve gone, but there is always room for improvement. In <a href="/#">this article</a> I discuss what those steps have been.</p>

<p>In this post, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what, if I were to start from zero, I would do. I hope that this article can serve as guidance to anyone looking to get into the software development field. It can be daunting to start learning programming on your own. What language to start? What courses and resources to use? How much to practice?</p>

<p>There is of course no right answer here, but if I were to start learning software development again, here is what I would do.</p>

<h3 id="start-slowish-and-be-cheap">Start Slow(ish) and Be Cheap</h3>
<p>Before you sign up for some bootcamp and cosign away 15% of your income for the next couple of years or quit your job to lock yourself in your parents’ basement for 6 months teaching yourself to code, you should see if you like it and get a lay of the land.</p>

<p>Life as a developer isn’t for everyone. Sure, everyone can learn to code, but that doesn’t mean it’s something you want to devote yourself to. Coding is interesting, engaging, and a constant challenge, but it totally has it’s down sides that might mean it’s not for you. You are sitting in front of a computer screen all day, often with no company, and you often get stuck digging into problems that make you want to tear your hair out, just to name a few downsides.</p>

<p>Before you fully commit to the life of code, learn the basics and make sure it’s the right choice for you. Plus, you’ll have a nice foundation for when/if you decide to dive full in.</p>

               href="/blog/personal/2020/04/25/Why-I'm-Becoming-a-Developer.html">Why I'm Becoming a Software Developer</a></h2>
        <p>I can put an exact date on when I decided I wanted to become a software developer. It was the night before my 25th birthday, November 1, 2019.</p>

<p>I was in Mexico City on vacation. I’d decided to go to CDMX for my birthday because my birthday, November 2, is also the Day of the Dead and that’s always something I’ve wanted to experience. And probably more importantly, I have a deep aversion to all the attention you get on your birthday. I wanted to not just escape that in a foreign country, but have it be overwhelmed by the attention granted to another holiday.</p>

<p>Plus, tacos al pastor, tequila, mesoamerican pyramids, mole, and more tacos al pastor. (Side note: I gained at least 5 pounds during my 2 weeks in Mexico.)</p>

<p>At the time I was working remotely in a marketing and sales position for a Silicon Valley startup from Medellin, Colombia. For a variety of reasons, I felt I was outgrowing the position. I knew that I wanted a way out, regardless of what’d be coming next.</p>

<p>Concurrently, I’d started studying a bit of front end development because it was relevant to some projects for the company and a side project e-commerce store I was working on. I liked it. There was a ton to learn, instant gratification when you get something right, and lots of career opportunities when you get good at it.</p>

<p>I was apprehensive about taking the leap into an entirely new field. It’d basically be starting from zero in a new career, and that wasn’t a decision I wanted to take lightly, especially because I’d just gotten into the world of tech and marketing less than 2 years previously.</p>

<p>But in a hyper-cliched ¼-life crisis move, on the afternoon before my 25th birthday, I decided that I need to make a career change. I think that it was an inevitability, but the birthday provided he catylist that I needed to take the leap.</p>

<p>The week I got back from the Mexico, I told my job I was quitting by the end of the year, and I dove deeper into programming. I’d spend the mornings and weekends upping my programming chops with the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>, and figuring out how I wanted to proceed with my studying. (I eventually decided that a bootcamp would be the best route for me, but that’s the subject for a different blog post.)</p>

<p>The more I immerse myself in the world of programming, the more I love it, something that continues to this day.</p>

I love programming, creating software, and am fascinated by everything having to do with digital entrepreneurship.

Currently, I'm working as a part-time **Full Stack Developer** for [Fullify](https://fullify.io){:target="_blank"} (webpage made by yours truly), a property manager marketing platform. I'm also doing some product marketing work for them, leveraging my previous background creating startup content. 

I'm a graduate of the [App Academy](https://appacademy.io/) online bootcamp, where I spent 6 months learning a whole bunch of technologies, programming fundamentals, and more. Prior to starting App Academy in February 2020, I had been studying programming independently using online resources like [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.org).

Before I dove into learning software development full-time, I was already working in the world of tech. My previous position was as **Market Development Lead at Mavatar Technologies**, a small Silicon Valley e-commerce startup. As Market Development Lead, I worked in close collaboration with Mavatar's executive team on sales, marketing and content campaigns. 

I also founded **PerlWrite**, a content creation organization, where I collaborated with startups to realize their content strategy in the form of website copy, eBooks, blog posts, email campaigns and more. 

Prior to transitioning to tech, I taught English in Seoul, South Korea and then Cuenca, Ecuador.

### Beyond the Coding
When I'm not hunched in front of my computer coding (though that is most of my life these days), I like to read, practice yoga (which I actually started to compensate for the back pain that all the keyboard hunching was causing, and have grown to quite like it, but I digress...), hang out with my friends, and get off the beaten path.

I'm also a passionate traveler and devoted believer in remote work. I have just returned to my native New York to seek employment as a software developer, but have spent the previous 4+ years living and working abroad. 

I've just returned from 2 years living in Medellin, Colombia where I enjoyed avocados the size of my head (see below),  year-round perfect weather, practicing Spanish, and plugging away at my keyboard at the city's many cafes which serve the world's best coffee (a bold statement that I stand firmly by).

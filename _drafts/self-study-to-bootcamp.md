title: Going from Self-Study to Bootcamp    
---

Self-study or bootcamp? It's ne of the great debates for those of us getting into programming and don't have the time/ability/desire to get a 4-year CS degree. Many YouTube videos, Medium posts and more have been devoted to this subject. It's basically a subgenre of the greater learn-to-code cannon. About 6 months ago, when I had resolved that I wanted to career change to software development, but was still in the process of figuring out what that'd actually entail, I read or watched basically everything I could find on the subject and talked to everyone with semi-relevant knowledge that I could. 

To sum up many conversations had, thousands of words read, and lord knows how many YouTube rabbit holes descended down to the Big Question: it depends. 

The consensus is that, yeah, you can probably self-study your way to gainful employment as a developer. All the resources are out there for free or very cheap on YouTube, blogs and Udemy. But it can be a challenge to organize these scattered resources into a real study path and stay motivated to stick with it. Even then, you're losing out on mentorship and collaboration opportunities. 

Bootcamps promise to fix all the problems that self studying presents with expert guidance and a focused curriculum...in exchange for a whole bunch of money. Even if they have ISAs and position it like their financial gain is solely conditional on your success while posting stellar employment numbers, recent exposes, [like that of Lambda School](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html), reveal that this can actually be fairly removed from the truth. 

I most certainly don't have a definitive answer here, but I do have experience self studying and am currently in the [App Academy](https://appacademy.io) online bootcamp. **My experience with both modes of learning programming has led be to believe that a bootcamp was the right decision, but I am also very, very glad that I had significant time self-studying before starting the bootcamp.**

Read on to learn some more about my experience, and why I believe this was the right path for me. 

## Beginnings: Directionless Self-Study (not recommended)
In late summer 2019, I decided that I wanted to learn "coding," whatever that meant. (I talk more about why I decided to career change into software development in [this blog post](/#)).

didn't really know how i wanted to start
* did some freecodeacademy 
* bopped around youtube video
* found udemy course that did a good job w HTML/CSS til the JS curriculum was pretty weak

results
* got a feel of the fundamentals, esp html/css
* but most importantly was that i realized this was a subject i was passionate about and wanted to dive deeper into

## Guided Self Study with the Odin Project (7/10)
* trajectory of my learning changed started using odin project, free online bootcamp
  * it had been recc'd to me by 3-4 or ppl separately, and saw online that a lot of the lesser bootcamps around were actually largely based on it 
* it provided enough structure to guide my learning, with its projects and collection of resources
* i was working thru it before i started the bootcamp
  * i made some projects, learned a bunch and was generally pretty satisfied 
  * for spending 0 dollars it was pretty damn good
* it wasn't perfect though: the nodeJS curriculum was fairly week compared to front-end JS, and they basically copped out of teaching front-end frameworks, which are now a basically essential part of applying for development work. 
  * should be noted that originally ruby-on-rails focused, so that curriculum is likely better than the JS one 
  * at the very least i'd say that anyone trying to get into web dev try out the Web Dev 101 curriculum, which was the best structured part of the curriculum that i did

## Finding the Right Bootcamp (App Academy)
* while i was still doing the odin project, i decided that i wanted to take my dev to the next level and ensure that i was getting quality education in programming
  * so i started researching bootcamps--there's a lot of them, all of which have their own pros and cons 
    * some have pros that are strong others cons
    * i was also set on doing it remotely from medellin, which restricted my options, though not too much b.c most of the prominent in-person ones now have online options
* A cautionary tale: my flirtation with Bloc
  * initially interested in Bloc, online only bootcamp with more flexible curriculum and generally pretty positive reviews
    * however, when i started looking at LinkedIn to see employment outcomes, i literally couldn't find a single student who was employed in a software-development job. not one. i'm sure some exist-i didn't look at every single graduate ever-but the fact i couldn't find anyone sends a pretty strong negative signal
    * this was confirmed when i talked to 
* i eventually resolved upon app academy b.c it was the only one that 1) had hours that aligned with my schedule, and i couldn't find basically any complaint about. 
  * to make sure this wasn't just a reflection of a stalinist-style marketing campaign to purge the interenet of all bad content (not uncommon in the online ed world), i reached out on linkedin to some recent graduates, who all said some variation on, "you'll work your ass off but come out of it a software development"
    * i decided i'll take it

## App Academy Online: So Far, So Good

## Conclusion: XXX 

## If I Were to Do it Again...
1. Learn the basics and see if becoming a software developer is really something you want to do 
   1. Finish Odin Project Web Dev 101 before committing yourself to any path (2 months, 10-15 hrs/week)
      1. if you've done this, you can probably get into any bootcamp you want
      2. and they usually have quick admissions turn around and are free (another way bootcamps disrupt traditional ed), so you don't have to worry about wasting time or money. plus they usually involve coding exericses where you'll learn a thing or 2 even if it doesn't work out.
   2. In free time, watch lots of YouTube videos about software development to learn more about the industry and culture
   3. talk to some real devs! see how they entered the industry, and what their advice to you is
      1. i was lucky enough to have lots of developer friends to talk to
      2. but if you don't know any, you can also reach out on linkedin (if you send random ppl flatting msgs on linkedin saying how you are impressed by their experience and want to chat w some questions, you'll get a >50% response rate...if you're going down this path make sure that you have a decently curated profile to leave a good 1st impression)
      3. i've also head good things about going to meetups. never done it, so can't speak to it personally
2. start researching and applying to bootcamps (4-6 weeks)
   1. continue with all the above steps, focus on the front-end JS part of Odin Project
      1. don't worry about the Ruby stuff for now
      2. Ruby isn't part of many modern bootcamp curriculums b/c the relative popularity of the language has faded
      3. JS should be part of any bootcamp, and if it's not, don't do that bootcamp
   2. but focus more specifically on talking to ppl who have done the various bootcamps you're considering
   3. research which bootcamps seem right for you
      1. when looking at any bootcamp, look specifically at:
         1. google search keywords like "XX bootcamp criticism", "XX bootcamp bad" etc....try to explicitly find the negative stuff people have said 
         2. check what has been said on reddit about the bootcamp. there is a very active learn to code community in pages like /r/learntocode
      2. reach out to a cross section of bootcamp students. include in this:
         1. graduates who are now employed in the type of jobs you want
         2. students currently in the bootcamp
         3. graduates who haven't found a job yet...getting a balanced perspective is important
      3. get in the admissions pipeline. put your name on some form, someone from admissions will probably get in contact to talk with you
         1. remember that by this point, you'll have a bunch of projects under your belt from TOP web dev 101, so you'll be a pretty compelling candidate
         2. also admissions for these bootcamps are basically their sales department. given that you're now a well qualified candidate, they want you just as much as you want them! 
      4. once you've researched bootcamps for a couple of weeks (while you're still coding everyday!!), there's a good chance that you'll have a couple of top choice bootcamps. the top ones for me were: 
         1. App Academy (what I'm currently doing)
         2. Hack Reactor (but their online hours would've been inconvenient for me on EST)
         3. Flatiron School (but they're owned by WeWork, which was at peak implosion when I was applying in Fall 2019, so I decided to avoid just to be safe)
      5. the admissions process will probably take a couple of weeks. once you get into a good bootcamp, congrats--you're the next step on your way to becoming a developer
3. bootcamp time (on avg. 3-6 months... but depends on length of your program)
   1. this one obviously most subjective, b/c depends on your program
   2. code is love, code is life
      1. make sure the bootcamp is the number 1 priority in your life as much as you are able to make it so
      2. it's just a couple of months of commitment. you can tough it up
      3. and you'll probably enjoy it to a certain extent b/c presumably you like to code, otherwise you wouldn't be here
   3. but i'll speak to my experience so far in app academy 
   4. do HW and come as prepared as possible to every lesson
   5. try to get as much code review from your teachers as possible
      1. one of the most valuable tools for learning to code is having someone with more experience than you look at it, and you're paying your teachers to be there, so you might as well take advantage of the fact that you have a captive audience their to help you as much as possible
   6. review on the weekends 
      1. make sure you have a good grasp on what you just learned the past week, presumably the bootcamp will build on itself, so you need to know that stuff going forward
          1.  or for the job interview process! 
   7. rinse and repeat

FOR THE ARTICLE ABOUT WHY I DECIDED TO GET INTO DEVELOPMENT
I was building an e-commerce startup store with Shopify at the time and was working on rebuilding the website of the e-commerce startup I was working for on Wordpress. I kept encountering barriers with stuff that I wanted to do to the websites, but didn't know how to due to lack of technical ability. I don't like when I can't do things I want to do, so I started with the "coding" to accomplish other goals.  -->

title: Going from Self-Study to Bootcamp    
---

Self-study or bootcamp? It's ne of the great debates for those of us getting into programming and don't have the time/ability/desire to get a 4-year CS degree. Many YouTube videos, Medium posts and more have been devoted to this subject. It's basically a subgenre of the greater learn-to-code cannon. About 6 months ago, when I had resolved that I wanted to career change to software development, but was still in the process of figuring out what that'd actually entail, I read or watched basically everything I could find on the subject and talked to everyone with semi-relevant knowledge that I could. 

To sum up many conversations had, thousands of words read, and lord knows how many YouTube rabbit holes descended down to the Big Question: it depends. 

The consensus is that, yeah, you can probably self-study your way to gainful employment as a developer. All the resources are out there for free or very cheap on YouTube, blogs and Udemy. But it can be a challenge to organize these scattered resources into a real study path and stay motivated to stick with it. Even then, you're losing out on mentorship and collaboration opportunities. 

Bootcamps promise to fix all the problems that self studying presents with expert guidance and a focused curriculum...in exchange for a whole bunch of money. Even if they have ISAs and position it like their financial gain is solely conditional on your success while posting stellar employment numbers, recent exposes, [like that of Lambda School](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html), reveal that this can actually be fairly removed from the truth. 

I most certainly don't have a definitive answer here, but I do have experience self studying and am currently in the [App Academy](https://appacademy.io) online bootcamp. **My experience with both modes of learning programming has led be to believe that a bootcamp was the right decision, but I am also very, very glad that I had significant time self-studying before starting the bootcamp.**

Read on to learn some more about my experience, and why I believe this was the right path for me. 

## Beginnings: Directionless Self-Study (not recommended)
In late summer 2019, I decided that I wanted to learn "coding," whatever that meant. (I talk more about why I decided to career change into software development in [this blog post](/#)).

didn't really know how i wanted to start
* did some [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* bopped around youtube video
* found udemy course that did a good job w HTML/CSS til the JS curriculum was pretty weak

results
* got a feel of the fundamentals, esp html/css
* but most importantly was that i realized this was a subject i was passionate about and wanted to dive deeper into

## Guided Self Study with the Odin Project (7/10)
* trajectory of my learning changed started using odin project, free online bootcamp
  * it had been recc'd to me by 3-4 or ppl separately, and saw online that a lot of the lesser bootcamps around were actually largely based on it 
* it provided enough structure to guide my learning, with its projects and collection of resources
* i was working thru it before i started the bootcamp
  * i made some projects, learned a bunch and was generally pretty satisfied 
  * for spending 0 dollars it was pretty damn good
* it wasn't perfect though: the nodeJS curriculum was fairly week compared to front-end JS, and they basically copped out of teaching front-end frameworks, which are now a basically essential part of applying for development work. 
  * should be noted that originally ruby-on-rails focused, so that curriculum is likely better than the JS one 
  * at the very least i'd say that anyone trying to get into web dev try out the Web Dev 101 curriculum, which was the best structured part of the curriculum that i did

## Finding the Right Bootcamp (App Academy)
* while i was still doing the odin project, i decided that i wanted to take my dev to the next level and ensure that i was getting quality education in programming
  * so i started researching bootcamps--there's a lot of them, all of which have their own pros and cons 
    * some have pros that are strong others cons
    * i was also set on doing it remotely from medellin, which restricted my options, though not too much b.c most of the prominent in-person ones now have online options
* A cautionary tale: my flirtation with Bloc
  * initially interested in Bloc, online only bootcamp with more flexible curriculum and generally pretty positive reviews
    * however, when i started looking at LinkedIn to see employment outcomes, i literally couldn't find a single student who was employed in a software-development job. not one. i'm sure some exist-i didn't look at every single graduate ever-but the fact i couldn't find anyone sends a pretty strong negative signal
    * this was confirmed when i talked to 
* i eventually resolved upon app academy b.c it was the only one that 1) had hours that aligned with my schedule, and i couldn't find basically any complaint about. 
  * to make sure this wasn't just a reflection of a stalinist-style marketing campaign to purge the interenet of all bad content (not uncommon in the online ed world), i reached out on linkedin to some recent graduates, who all said some variation on, "you'll work your ass off but come out of it a software development"
    * i decided i'll take it

## App Academy Online: So Far, So Good (8.5/10)
* at time of writing i'm 9 weeks into the app academy online bootcamp. i'd say i'm pretty satisfied so far
* it moves very fast, but explains topics very well and in a logical manner
  * for example, topics that would take me a full day to half-understand in a day of self study, aA teaches in 2 hours and i fully understand it, and then practice exercises to drill in the concepts
* the instruction is pretty good
  * know the material well and are fairly good at conveying it clearly
  * there are also some really great readings and decent video explanations that we cover before going through anything at a class that help a lot 
* i like pair programming more than anticipated 
  * one of the core features of the aA curriculum is its emphasis on pair programming, which is where you are doing all your coding with a partner
    * one person is the 'navigator', giving direction to what should be written. the other is the 'driver', who is actually implementing the code and providing feedback
  * before the bootcamp, i'd never pair programmed before and i was uncertain how i'd feel about it
    * would it be tedious and slow?
    * what i didn't like the person i was pairing with? 
  * but now after 2+ months of pair programming, i can definitively say: **i am a fan of pair programming**. 
    * the social aspect keeps you going w/o distraction longer than you otherwise could
      * probably biggest factor
    * you get to learn from other student's and their knowledge, or teach them yours, which i think is one of the best ways to solidify your knowledge.
    * and working through with someone keeps you sharper, as you have to constantly verbalize what you're doing, you're more likely to catch mistakes you're making or those of your partner 
* time commitment isn't too excessive
  * as noted above, i was told by everyone i had talked to that the bootcamp would require really working your ass off. sleepless nights, no weekends, that fun stuff
    * as someone who very much enjoys his 8 hours of sleep/night and keeping my computer screen as closed as possible during the weekend, i was a little apprehensive about this aspect of the course 
      * i decided i would be willing to do it, but still sleep and weekends are nice and not something i particularly wanted to give up
  * luckily for me, these fears have turned out to be overblown. i'd say i work on average 50-60 hours a week. a lot, but not so much that it interferes with sleep or doesn't permit me to relax on the weekends. 
    * i think this is largely due to curriculum changes made to aA this year that extend the course a month, to 5 months instead of four. so this gives us an extra month to cover the same curriculum, providing some more breathing room. 
  * i appreciate that the course isn't fully life consuming b.c I like to have a life. and do other things like work on this blog! 
* negatives
  * not much of a community, but i guess that's to be expected with online learning
  * sometimes the projects are lighter or too "hand-holdy" imo, but still learning all the relevant topics
  * some days where i question if getting my money's worth (20K upfront, 31K with ISA), but then i compare to my self study and think back to how much more i'm learning how much quicker, and begrudgingly admit that it most definitely is
* TDDE: test drive development education
  * one aspect that i kinda thought would be awful but have grown to respect if not like is the weekly assessments. every week on monday morning, we have a pass/fail test on the previous week's material. if you don't pass (which is usually 80%, but could theoretically be lower if a lot of people don't reach that bar), you get sent back to the previous cohort, which is a month behind. so every week you risk getting sent back a month. harsh. 
    * but none of the assessments are hard. it's a test designed for you to pass, or likely even get a 100% if you have absorbed the easier 75% of the previous week's material. so really it's assessing if you've understood (.80*75) like 60% of the previous week, not too bad.
      * and if you didn't get that much, advancing will generally be hard b.c the material really builds upon itself
  * it should be noted that while i have done pretty well under the system, passing w relative ease, that can't be said for the majority of my cohort. 
    * as of writing, at week 9 almost 2/3 of the students that we started out with have failed at least 1 assessment and gotten sent back with a few even dropping out.
    * i'm still not sure what to make of this fact. i think in part it is probably a failure of aA admissions to ID potential. or maybe it's a failure to attract talent, which means that they let in people they aren't confident will succeed. 
      * or maybe they just accept people who have the ability, but are too 'green', without a decent foundation in coding, and they get overwhelmed by the machine gun of info thrown at them. 
  * i still haven't fully formed an opinion on these assessments
    * it keeps me on my toes and pushes me to study more
    * and for aA acts as a filter, so they're only graduating student they are confident will succeed
    * but even if it's working for me, and working for aA, the 2/3 of my starting cohort who have now failed at least 1 assessment only 9 weeks in probably have some other perspectives on the matter. 
## Conclusion: It has only just begun...
* as of writing i'm agout 8 months into my journey of learning to code, and just under 4 months of doing it full time, with the last 2 months doing this bootcamp. 
  * i'm learning everyday and continue to love programming
* while i can do a hell of a lot more than i could 8 months ago, i still have so much to learn before i feel that i'm comfortably employable, let alone good at this stuff
  * it really is humbling

FOR THE ARTICLE ABOUT WHY I DECIDED TO GET INTO DEVELOPMENT
I was building an e-commerce startup store with Shopify at the time and was working on rebuilding the website of the e-commerce startup I was working for on Wordpress. I kept encountering barriers with stuff that I wanted to do to the websites, but didn't know how to due to lack of technical ability. I don't like when I can't do things I want to do, so I started with the "coding" to accomplish other goals.  -->

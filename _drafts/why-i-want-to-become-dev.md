<!-- 
FOR THE ARTICLE ABOUT WHY I DECIDED TO GET INTO DEVELOPMENT
I was building an e-commerce startup store with Shopify at the time and was working on rebuilding the website of the e-commerce startup I was working for on Wordpress. I kept encountering barriers with stuff that I wanted to do to the websites, but didn't know how to due to lack of technical ability. I don't like when I can't do things I want to do, so I started with the "coding" to accomplish other goals.  -->

title: Why I Am Becoming a Software Developer
---

* i can put a date on when i decided i wanted to become a software developer
      * it was my 25th birthday eve
      * i was in mexico city on vacation
      * i had chosen to go to CDMX then b.c my birthday coincided with day of the dead, nov 2, which i had wanted to experience
        * and probably more important, i have a deep aversion to birthday attention. i wanted to not just escape it, but have it be overwhelmed by that of another holiday 
        * plus, *tacos al pastor* (side note: i gained at least 5 lbs. during my 2 weeks in mexico)
          * (side side note: i could never live in mexico b.c i'd become obese w.in 6 months)
  * at the time i was working in a remote sales and marketing position for a silicon valley startup, but for a variety of reasons, I was really dissatisfied with the position. i knew i wanted a way out, regardless of what'd be coming next 
    * concurrently, i had started studying a bit of front end development b/c it was relevant to some projects for this startup and a side project e-commerce store i was working on. 
      * i liked it. there was a ton to learn, instant gratification when you get something right, and lots of career opportunities when you get good at it 
        * but i was apprehensive about taking the leap into an entirely new field — it'd basically be starting from zero in a new career. that wasn't a decision i wanted  to take lightly, esp. as i had just gotten into the world of tech on the marketing and sales side a year and a half previously. 
  * in a hyper-cliched 1/4-life move, i decided i needed to make a career change
    * i think it was an inevitability, but the birthday provided the catalyst, the natural turning point that i needed to make the jump
    * the next week, i told my job that i was going to quit at the end of the year, and dove deeper into programming
      * spending my mornings and weekends upping my programming chops with the Odin Project and figuring out how i wanted to proceed with my studying (i eventually decided that a bootcamp would be the best route for me, but that's the subject of a different post)
  * the more i immersed myself in the world of programming, the more i loved it. somthing that continues to this day. 
    * below i talk about some of my favorite aspects of software development, which inspire me every day to become a better developer and learn more.

## Infinite Learning Opportunity
* i'm a nerd, and i ain't afraid to say it. i like to learn. 
    * i could and do happily spend an hour or 2 down a wikipedia rabbit hole about mid-19th century South American inter-regional relations or read some read weird hard sci fi book—shout out to isaac asamov, ted chiang and Liu Cixin. 
* the number 1 thing that i love about programming (#listicle) is that there is pretty much infinite learning opportunity
  * as much as you know, there is a helluva lot more out there, and even if you're master of a feild, you gotta keep learning otherwise you'll be practically a relic in 5 years 
* and all the learning is applied, with most of it even being free on the internet
  * that's pretty darn cool
## Interesting Work 
* you get to work on interesting problems, and create solutions that have a genuine impact on the world
* every project is different, requiring you to learn more and implement novel solutions
* instant gratification..if something is working you can test and iterate right away.
  * it's a little dopamine hit that keeps you going
## Remote Friendliness
* if you have 30mbs of internet and a decent laptop, you can probably work as a developer regardless of where you are (timezone permitting)
* and i'm a passionate traveler and devoted believer in the efficacy of remote work
  * i have been living abroad for the last 4 years and working remotely for US companies for 2 years prior to devoting myself to learning software full-time, from my current home in Medellin, Colombia. 
* so the prospect of having a career that gives me the flexibility to work from anywhere is deeply personally appealing
  * i accept the fact that for the first couple of years of my developer career i'll likely have to be in person as many companies only do entry-level jobs in person
    * and i look forward to learning from more senior developers 
    * but as of now, it is my ultimate goal to return to remote work at some point in the not too distant future, be it in 1 year, 3 or 5.                         
## Good Salaries
* being a developer pays. it is no secret
  * this is of course one of my main motivations for becoming a software developer. 
  * anyone who says otherwise is probably a liar
* moreover, it is probably the single best way to earn a good US salary while living outside the country.
* this isn't my principal motivation—if making lots of money were my main goal i would have gotten into finance or gone to law school—but it certainly is something that matters to me, especially as i leave my early 20s and get into the meat of adulthood and pay for my own health insurance (thanks Obama for getting me to 26 on the parent's tab though!). 
## Future-Proof*
* software isn't going anywhere. it's going everywhere
  * basically every company is a tech company these days
    * and they need people to make that technology
  * due to some gross inadequacies in the US educational system, there's a severe shortage of practitioners in software development. 
* so ample job opportunity will exist for software developers for the foreseeable future
  * that's something i certainly have in mind as i enjoy being gainfully employed

## Conclusion
* i'm just at the beginning of my journey into the world of software development, but so far i love it, and that love it only increasing
* i have a long way to go, and i'm looking forward to every step of it.

FOR THE ARTICLE ABOUT WHY I DECIDED TO GET INTO DEVELOPMENT
I was building an e-commerce startup store with Shopify at the time and was working on rebuilding the website of the e-commerce startup I was working for on Wordpress. I kept encountering barriers with stuff that I wanted to do to the websites, but didn't know how to due to lack of technical ability. I don't like when I can't do things I want to do, so I started with the "coding" to accomplish other goals.  -->

I'm a software developer currently studying programming at the [App Academy](https://appacademy.io/) online bootcamp. I love programming, creating software, and learning the inner-workings of the internet. Prior to starting App Academy in February 2020, I had been studying programming independly using online resources like [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.org).

Before I dove into learning software development full-time, I was already working in the world of tech. My previous position was as Market Development Lead at Mavatar Technologies, a small Silicon Valley e-commerce startup. As Market Development Lead, I worked in close collaboration with Mavatar's executive team on sales, marketing and content campaigns. 

I also founded PerlWrite, a content creation organization, where I collaborated with startups to realize their content strategy in the form of website copy, eBooks, blog posts, email campaigns and more.

## Beyond the Coding
---
<br>
When I'm not hunched in front of my computer coding (though that is most of my life these days), I like to read, practice yoga (which I actually started to compensate for the back pain that all the keyboard hunching was causing, and have grown to quite like it, but I digress...), hang out with my friends, and get off the beaten path.

I'm also a passionate traveler and believer in remote work. Currently, I'm based in Medellin, Colombia where I enjoy  avocados the size of my head (see below), the year-round perfect weather, practicing Spanish, and plugging away at my keyboard at the city's many cafes which serve the world's best coffee (a strong statement that I stand firmly by).

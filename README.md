My personal website, built with Jekyll static site builder. April 2020 — ongoing

The primary goal for this website, like any personal page, is to show off myself and my programming abilities. The website is a constant work in progress, as I grow as a programmer and learn Jekyll, the technology that I'm using to build the site.

## Why a Jekyll site?
### Easy deployment
First and foremost, Jekyll sites are incredibly well integrated with GitHub and GitHub Pages, making it probably the best tool for quickly spinning up a robust personal site with blog functionality. 

### Extendability and Customization
Jekyll also has a lot of extendability, with a lot of free plugins to build up the site, and is very customization friendly for when the available ecosystem doesn't meet my needs. 

### Learn new technologies
Jekyll is dependent on a couple of technologies that I've wanted to learn for a while now. It is built with Ruby, and uses the Liquid templating engine. I've wanted to learn Liquid since I made a Shopify website about 8 months ago (Shopify pages are built with Liquid, and Shopify was actually the original developer. The website was a quickly-failed made-to-order t-shirt e-commerce site...a story for a different time). 

I have some vivid memories of wanting to change some aspects of the site beyond the scope of the UI sitebuilder, but being absolutely stonewalled while staring at the Liquid code in perplexion. It was experiences like this one—where I wanted to build a digital product, but didn't have the ability to do so—that first got me into programming. In addition to the inherent utility (and fun!) of learning a new technology, it's this drive to be able to do what I wanted to do before but couldn't that motivates me to learn Liquid.

## More to Come…
As the site grows, I’ll add more to this README.But for now you can just check out [bpmutter.github.io](https://bpmutter.github.io/)!
